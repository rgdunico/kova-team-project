We definitely recommend them and look forward to working with them again. ',

      'I cannot say enough about this company. After working in the commercial construction industry for 26 years, I am very familiar with the habits of contractors. We had a complete remodel of our kitchen and dinning room. The old cabinets were taken out and new ones installed and we added a 10 foot cabinet added in the dinning room. Extensive lighting work was done and new countertops installed. These guys blew us away! They contradict everything known about the habits of contractors. Their behavior is extremely professional, they show up, on time, every time, they work hard while they are here and are here all day every day. We had comments from neighbors saying how shocked they were to see the trucks out front every day, all day. Their craftsmanship is perfection and is performed in a timely manner. They were very amenable to how we wanted things and  did everything like we wanted it. Their prices were the best of all the 3 bids we received. We love our new kitchen and dinning room. Thank you to the team at AAR! ',
